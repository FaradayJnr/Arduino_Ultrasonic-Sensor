# Arduino_Ultrasonic-Sensor

Interfacing ultrasonic sensor with arduino microcontroller.
Ultrasonic sensor works on two operations: Transmission and Recieving.
Arduino Microcontroller is used to controll these operations of the sensor. As follows:

The sensor sends an echo(output signal) to the impending object.
The signal reflects and comes to the sensor as a digital signal or input signal.

In this project, the distance travelled in cm is calculated through measurement of the duration and the speed of sound(340m/s).

In process, a system with this setup will be able to sense an obstacle from the distance measured in the set time.
